You can explore data assimilation in any way you want. Feel free to use any of the code in previous notebooks and expand on it by writing more code of your own.\n","\n","Here are some options:\n","\n","### Option 1: Explore reconstructions you made in the last notebook\n","\n","Feel free to run some different reconstructions using the code in the last notebook. What happens if you only assimilate certain proxy types or certain regions? What happens if you change the proxy uncertainty? Look through the settings and run some experiments that interest you.\n","\n","To load a reconstruction saved in your \"da_activities/data\" folder, copy the line below. Make sure to open the folder and check the filename of the experiment you want to open.\n","\n","> data_xarray = xr.open_dataset('/content/drive/MyDrive/da_activities/data/filename.nc')\n","\n","### Option 2: Explore published reconstructions in more depth\n","\n","In Notebook 3, you loaded different published reconstructions to look at temperature. Feel free to go back and do a new analysis, either with temperature or a new variable. Some output has already been made available in the \"da_activities/data\" folder (take a look!), but other outputs are available for some reconstructions, so feel free to download more data at the links below.\n","\n","| Reconstruction | Temporal Coverage | Variables | Data Link | Code Link |\n","| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n","| Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR 2.0) | 0 - 2000 CE | Temp, Precip, and More | https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/27850 | https://github.com/modons/LMR |\n","| Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA) | 1 - 2000 CE | Temp and Precip | https://zenodo.org/record/1198817 | https://github.com/njsteiger/PHYDA |\n","| Last Glacial Maximum reanalysis (LGMr) | 0 - 24000 yr BP | Temp and d18O | https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/33112 | https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH |\n","| Holocene Reconstruction | 0 - 12000 yr BP | Temp | https://zenodo.org/record/6426332 | https://github.com/Holocene-Reconstruction/Holocene-code |\n","\n","### Option 3: Explore proxy data in more depth\n","\n","If you're most interested in proxy data, feel free to go back to Notebook 2 and explore the proxy records in the Temp12k database.\n","\n","## Your goal: Make a figure or other analysis\n","\n","Whatever analysis you want to do, make some figures.
