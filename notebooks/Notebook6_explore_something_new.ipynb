You can explore data assimilation in any way you want. Feel free to use any of the code in previous notebooks and expand on it by writing more code of your own.\n","\n","Here are some options:\n","\n","### Option 1: Explore reconstructions you made in the last notebook\n","\n","Feel free to run some different reconstructions using the code in the last notebook. What happens if you only assimilate certain proxy types or certain regions? What happens if you change the proxy uncertainty? Look through the settings and run some experiments that interest you.\n","\n","To load a reconstruction stored in your Google Colab folder, copy the first line below. To load a reconstruction saved in the \"da_workshop/data\" folder, copy the second line below. In either case, open the folder to check the filename of the experiment you want to open.\n","\n","> data_xarray = xr.open_dataset('/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/filename.nc')\n","\n","> data_xarray = xr.open_dataset('/content/drive/MyDrive/da_workshop/data/filename.nc')\n","\n","### Option 2: Explore published reconstructions in more depth\n","\n","In Notebook 3, you loaded different published reconstructions to look at temperature. Feel free to go back and do a new analysis, either with temperature or a new variable. Some output has already been made available in the \"da_workshop/data\" folder (take a look!), but other outputs are available for some reconstructions, so feel free to download more data at the links below.\n","\n","| Reconstruction | Temporal Coverage | Variables | Data Link | Code Link |\n","| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n","| Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR 2.0) | 0 - 2000 CE | Temp, Precip, and More | https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/27850 | https://github.com/modons/LMR |\n","| Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA) | 1 - 2000 CE | Temp and Precip | https://zenodo.org/record/1198817 | https://github.com/njsteiger/PHYDA |\n","| Last Glacial Maximum reanalysis (LGMr) | 0 - 24000 yr BP | Temp and d18O | https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/33112 | https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH |\n","| Holocene Reconstruction | 0 - 12000 yr BP | Temp | https://zenodo.org/record/6426332 | https://github.com/Holocene-Reconstruction/Holocene-code |\n","\n","### Option 3: Explore a Proxy System Model (PSM) in greater detail\n","\n","If you're most interested in Proxy System Models (PSMs), check out the folder \"da_workshop/optional_activity_PSM\". It contains an activity about a Speleothem PSM from Sylvia Dee.\n","\n","### Option 4: Explore proxy data in more depth\n","\n","If you're most interested in proxy data, feel free to go back to Notebook 2 and explore the proxy records in the Temp12k database.\n","\n","## Your goal: Make a figure or other analysis\n","\n","Whatever analysis you want to do, make some figures. You can copy code into this notebook (I've provided a starting point below) or go back and work on a previous notebook. Once you've made an interesting figure, right click and save it. Save your notebooks too! If you have a question for me, notify me in Slack by typing a message starting with \"@Michael Erb\".\n","\n","### Share your findings\n","\n","Share your findings in the \"general\" channel on our Slack (especially if you're in a distant time zone). You don't need to worry about making flawless final figures. Just share what you've got. Hackathons are all about exploration!\n","\n","We'll also be sharing some figures live during the first session on Zoom tomorrow, and we'll have some time for Q&A tomorrow too.\n","\n","We'll also have some more talks on Zoom tomorrow, so make sure to tune in. Have fun!\n","\n","**This is the final notebook for Day 2 of the Paleo DA Workshop. Join us on our Zoom link at 9 AM PDT tomorrow (time zone permitting) to share results, do some Q&A, and listen to more talks.
