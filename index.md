## Paleoclimate Data Assimilation
### Materials for learning about paleoclimate proxies, models, and data assimilation

Past climate offers a vast canvas for exploring the dynamics and natural variability in the climate system. Proxy data (e.g., ice cores, sediment cores, speleothems, etc.) and climate models offer two fantastic ways of exploring the climate system, and both approaches have strengths and weaknesses. **Data assimilation** is a method of combining information from proxies and models to create spatially complete reconstructions of past climate.

In these materials, you'll get an overview of paleoclimate data assimilation in several ways. Research presentations will explore current and ongoing data assimilation work; lessons will dive into the topics of proxies, models, the mathematics of data assimilation (and more); and activities will allow uers to get hands on with existing climate reconstructions and run their own.

Materials are divided between PDFs and activities, which you can find at the links above or below. To start, load the first PDF. Or, if you want to get more hands on, load the first activity.

These materials are adapted from a workshop which took place online on August 21-23, 2023.
