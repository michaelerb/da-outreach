## Activities

In this section, you can find interactive Python code to learn more about paleoclimate reconstructions and data assimilation.

### Getting set up

We'll be using Google Colabratory to run code. To do so, you'll need a Google Drive account. If you don't already have one, go to <a href="https://drive.google.com/">https://drive.google.com/</a> and set up a free account. After you've done that, follow the steps below.
  1. Go to Google Drive (<a href="https://drive.google.com/">https://drive.google.com/</a>), and click "New", then "New folder" to create a folder called "da_activities".
  2. Use the links below to download the six activity notebooks and upload them to your new Google Drive folder.
  3. Once uploaded to Google Drive, double-click a Notebook to open it in Google Colab. From there, you can read through the instructions and click the little "play" buttons to run code.

Have fun!
