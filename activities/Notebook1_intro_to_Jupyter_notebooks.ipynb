Setting things up for this workshop\n","\n","The code and data for the Paleo DA Workshop is stored on my (Michael Erb's) Google Drive. You can run notebooks, edit notebooks, and access data, but to save an edited notebook you need to create your own copy of the file. So the first time you open a notebook, go ahead and save a copy (Step 1 below). The other two steps only need to be done right now.\n","\n","**Step 1. Create a copy of this file:** In the toolbar at the top of this page, go to \"File\" > \"Save a copy in Drive\". A new file will be saved in the \"Colab Notebooks\" folder in your Google Drive and automatically open. To make a more memorable filename, change the initial part of the filename (\"Copy of \") to your name. In this new file, you can edit code and save all of your changes.\n","\n","**Step 2. Accessing data from my Drive:** To access data that I've already downloaded, do the following:\n","- Go to the main \"da_workshop\" folder in Google Drive.\n","- Click the downward arrow to the right of the \"da_workshop\" name.\n","- Click Organize > Add Shortcut.\n","- Click All locations > My Drive > Add.\n","\n","This will create a shortcut of the \"da_workshop\" folder in your Google Drive, allowing you to access data from that folder when you execute code.\n","\n","**Step 3. Create data and figure folders:** Finally, create two folders to save data and figures that you create. In your Google Drive, open the \"Colab Notebooks\" folder and create two empty folders: \"data\" and \"figures\". You'll be saving things in these folders in later notebooks.\n","\n","Each time you open a new notebook from my Drive, do step 1. That will make a copy you can edit and save.

Final notes\n","\n","A few things to note:\n","- Google Colab does have some limitations on RAM and Disk space, so memory-intensive analyses may fail. You can see your RAM and Disk usage in the upper right part of the page.\n","- If you want to convert a Google Colab notebook into normal python code (for use in Linux after the workshop), just go to File > Download > Download .py. You will also need to download any datasets you're using.\n","- If you want to learn more about Google Colab, check out this page: https://colab.research.google.com/. (Click \"Cancel\" when prompted to make a new notebook.)\n","- You can also use R in Google Colab notebooks. We'll only be using Python in this workshop, but if you want to use R in Google Colab in the future, refer to this page: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-r-in-google-colab-b6e02d736497."],"metadata":{"id":"JMeUhlHZ3olt"}}]}
