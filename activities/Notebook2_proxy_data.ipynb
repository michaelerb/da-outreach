These proxy records can be visualized here: https://lipdverse.org/Temp12k/current_version/ and downloaded on the left side of that page.  In this activity, we'll use the pickle file for the v1.0.2 version of that database, which is already downloaded in the \"da_workshop/data/\" folder. These Temp 12k proxy records are a main source of data for the Erb et al. 2022 Holocene Reconstruction.
